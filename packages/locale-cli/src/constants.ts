export const POLKADOT_CONTEXT = `
Polkadot is a blockchain platform that enables multiple specialized blockchains to interoperate in a shared security model. It uses a Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism.

The Polkadot Staking Dashboard is a web application that allows users to:
- Stake their DOT tokens by nominating validators
- Join nomination pools for collective staking
- Monitor their staking rewards and performance
- Manage their bonded funds and nominations
- Track validator performance and commission rates

Key staking concepts:
- Validators: Nodes that validate blocks and secure the network
- Nominators: Token holders who back validators with their stake
- Nomination Pools: Allow users to pool their stake together
- Commission: The percentage validators take from staking rewards
- Bonding: Locking tokens for staking (with an unbonding period)
- Era: A time period in Polkadot (approximately 24 hours)

When translating, maintain technical accuracy for blockchain and staking terminology while making the interface accessible to users.

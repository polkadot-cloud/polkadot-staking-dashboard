          "question": "What is staking?",
          "answer": "Staking means locking up your {network} ({token}) to help run and secure the {network} network. In return, you can earn rewards. It's a way to participate in the network and support its operations."

        {
          "id": "why-important",
          "question": "Why is staking important?",
          "answer": "Staking helps keep the {network} network safe and running smoothly. The more people stake their {token}, the more secure and reliable the network becomes."
        },
        {
          "id": "types-of-staking",
          "question": "What are the different types of staking?",
          "answer": "You can stake on your own (solo staking) or join with others in a group (pool staking). Pool staking is easier for most people and lets you start with a smaller amount of {token}."
        },
        {
          "id": "staking-risks",
          "question": "What are the risks of staking?",
          "answer": "Staking is generally safe, but there are risks. For example, if you break the rules, you could lose some of your staked {token} (this is called slashing). Also, your {token} is locked for a period and can't be used right away."
        },
        {
          "id": "how-to-start",
          "question": "How do I start staking?",
          "answer": "To start staking, choose the {network} network, select a staking method (solo or pool), and follow the steps in your wallet or dashboard. Pool staking is recommended for beginners."
        },
        {
          "id": "staking-rewards",
          "question": "What are staking rewards?",
          "answer": "Staking rewards are extra {token} you earn for helping the {network} network. The amount depends on how much you stake and the network's rules."
        },
        {
          "id": "can-lose-funds",
          "question": "Can I lose my funds?",
          "answer": "If you follow the rules, staking your {token} is safe. But if you act against the network (like trying to cheat), you could lose some of your staked {token}."
        },
        {
          "id": "how-to-stop",
          "question": "How do I stop staking?",
          "answer": "You can stop staking at any time, but your {token} may be locked for a short period (called the unbonding period) before you can use it again."

          "id": "what-is-staking",
          "question": "What is staking?",
          "answer": "Staking is the process of locking up your {network} ({token}) to participate in the consensus and security of a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain. Stakers (nominators or validators) help validate transactions and produce new blocks, earning rewards in return."
        },
        {
          "id": "why-important",
          "question": "Why is staking important?",
          "answer": "Staking is critical for {network} network security and decentralization. By staking your {token}, you contribute to the chain's resistance to attacks and help maintain its integrity. Staking also aligns incentives between network participants and the protocol."
        },
        {
          "id": "types-of-staking",
          "question": "What are the different types of staking?",
          "answer": "Staking can be done as a solo validator, as a nominator (delegating your {token} to validators), or by joining a nomination pool. Each method has different requirements, risks, and reward structures. Advanced users may also explore liquid staking and staking derivatives."
        },
        {
          "id": "staking-risks",
          "question": "What are the risks of staking?",
          "answer": "Risks include slashing (loss of {token} for validator misbehavior), lock-up periods (illiquidity), and potential changes in network rules. Pool participants also depend on the pool's performance and security."
        },
        {
          "id": "how-to-start",
          "question": "How do I start staking?",
          "answer": "Choose a staking method (solo, pool, or liquid), select a validator or pool, and bond your {token} using a supported wallet or dashboard. Review {network}-specific requirements and fees."
        },
        {
          "id": "staking-rewards",
          "question": "What are staking rewards?",
          "answer": "Rewards are distributed to stakers based on their contribution to {network} network security and block production. Rewards depend on network inflation, your staked {token}, validator performance, and commission rates."
        },
        {
          "id": "can-lose-funds",
          "question": "Can I lose my funds?",
          "answer": "Yes. {token} can be lost due to slashing (if your validator misbehaves), bugs, or protocol changes. Always research validators and pools before staking your {token}."
        },
        {
          "id": "how-to-stop",
          "question": "How do I stop staking?",
          "answer": "Unbond your {token} through your wallet or dashboard. After the unbonding period, your {token} becomes transferable again. The unbonding period varies by network."
        },
        {
          "id": "what-is-slashing",
          "question": "What is slashing?",
          "answer": "Slashing is a penalty for validators (and sometimes nominators) who break {network} network rules, such as double-signing or downtime. A portion of the staked {token} is destroyed or redistributed as punishment."
        },
        {
          "id": "what-is-nomination",
          "question": "What is nomination?",
          "answer": "Nomination is the act of selecting one or more validators to stake your {token} on your behalf. Nominators share in the rewards and risks of the validators they support."
        },
        {
          "id": "what-is-validator",
          "question": "What is a validator?",
          "answer": "A validator is a participant who locks up {token} and runs a node to produce blocks and validate transactions on the {network} network. Validators earn rewards and can be penalized for misbehavior."
        },
        {
          "id": "what-is-nomination-pool",
          "question": "What is a nomination pool?",
          "answer": "A nomination pool is a group of users who combine their {token} to nominate validators together. Pools make staking accessible to users with smaller balances and automate some management tasks."
        },
        {
          "id": "what-is-compounding",
          "question": "What is compounding in staking?",
          "answer": "Compounding means regularly adding your staking rewards to your staked {token}, increasing your future rewards. Some networks or pools offer automatic compounding."
        },
        {
          "id": "what-is-unbonding-period",
          "question": "What is the unbonding period?",
          "answer": "The unbonding period is the time you must wait after stopping staking before your {token} becomes available for transfer. This period helps protect the {network} network from sudden changes in stake."

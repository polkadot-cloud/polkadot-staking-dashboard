        },
        "what-is-nomination-pool": {

        "what-is-slashing": {
          "a": "Slashing is a penalty for validators (and sometimes nominators) who break {network} network rules, such as double-signing or downtime. A portion of the staked {token} is destroyed or redistributed as punishment.",

        "what-is-staking": {
          "a": "Staking is the process of locking up your {network} ({token}) to participate in the consensus and security of a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain. Stakers (nominators or validators) help validate transactions and produce new blocks, earning rewards in return.",

        },
        "what-is-unbonding-period": {
          "a": "The unbonding period is the time you must wait after stopping staking before your {token} becomes available for transfer. This period helps protect the {network} network from sudden changes in stake.",

        "what-is-validator": {
          "a": "A validator is a participant who locks up {token} and runs a node to produce blocks and validate transactions on the {network} network. Validators earn rewards and can be penalized for misbehavior.",

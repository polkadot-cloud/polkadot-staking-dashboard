## Reporting a Security Concern

**DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE** to report a security problem.

Go to [https://github.com/gluwa/creditcoin-staking-dashboard/security/advisories/new](https://github.com/gluwa/creditcoin-staking-dashboard/security/advisories/new) and open a vulnerability report. Send an email to [security@gluwa.com](mailto:security@gluwa.com) and provide your GitHub username. The team will triage the issue from there.

For security reasons, DO NOT include attachments or provide detail sufficient for exploitation regarding the security issue in this email. Instead, wait for the advisory to be created, and **provide any sensitive details in the private GitHub advisory**.

If you haven't done so already, please **enable two-factor authentication** in your GitHub account.

Send the email from an email domain that is less likely to get flagged for spam by Gmail.

This is an actively monitored account, and the team will quickly respond.

If you do not receive a response within 24 hours, please directly follow up with the team in [Discord](https://discord.gg/creditcoin) by reaching out to anyone with the role “Creditcoin Team”.

As above, please DO NOT include attachments or provide detail regarding the security issue in this email.
